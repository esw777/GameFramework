# GameFramework
Generic game features/libraries

Beginnings of a framework for a tile based base builder type game.

Built using the Unity Engine. C#. Visual Studios.

Currently implemented:

1. A* pathfinding

2. Job queue

3. Basic UI

4. Two types of objects - built objects (walls/tables/furniture) and loose objects (swords, clothes, ore.)


TODO:

1. Save/Load.

2. Map generation.

3. Character stats - hunger / sleep / etc.

4. Additional objects + Expand on the loose object stuff to match complexity of built objects.

5. Add priorities to job system - Add intelligent job picking ai - prefer closer jobs, jobs that character has higher skills in. Sleep/Eat over "work" jobs.

6. Put objects and other stuff into external files to increase modability.
