# GameFramework
Generic game features/libraries

Beginnings of a framework for a tile based base builder type game.

Built using the Unity Engine. C#. Visual Studios.

Currently implemented:
A* pathfinding
Job queue
Basic UI
Two types of objects - built objects (walls/tables/furniture) and loose objects (swords, clothes, ore.)


TODO:
Save/Load.
Map generation.
Character stats - hunger / sleep / etc.
Additional objects + Expand on the loose object stuff to match complexity of built objects.
Add priorities to job system. 
Add intelligent job picking ai - prefer closer jobs, jobs that character has higher skills in. Sleep/Eat over "work" jobs.
Put objects and other stuff into external files to increase modability.
